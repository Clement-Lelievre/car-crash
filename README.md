This is a team project at Le Wagon coding school. 
From a gigantic car crash database, we pull out meaningful insights and implement a machine learning model in order to make car crash severity prediction for future trips.
The user inputs his/her trip data on our Streamlit website, and our model spits out its prediction.

The website is coded with Streamlit on Heroku, here it is: https://carcrashdemo.herokuapp.com/
